# Welcome to My Blog

Hello! This is the first post on my new blog, built with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

1. **Research insights** - Summaries and reflections on papers I'm reading or writing
2. **Technical tutorials** - Guides on tools and techniques I find useful
3. **Career thoughts** - Reflections on academic life and research

## Why This Blog?

As a researcher, I spend a lot of time reading, thinking, and writing. This blog is a place to share some of those thoughts publicly.

> [!note] Obsidian Integration
> This site is built from my Obsidian vault, so I can use all the features I love:
> - [[index|Wiki-links]] to connect ideas
> - Backlinks to see related content
> - Callouts like this one for emphasis

## Stay Connected

You can find me on:
- Twitter: [@yourusername](https://twitter.com/yourusername)
- GitHub: [yourusername](https://github.com/yourusername)

Or check out my [[publications/index|publications]] and [[projects/index|projects]].
