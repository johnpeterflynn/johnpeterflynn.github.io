I'm a **Senior Machine Learning Researcher** and founding employee at [Pipio](https://pipio.ai), where my team and I build video editing tools powered by diffusion transformers. We just released a new paper called [EditYourself](https://edit-yourself.github.io/).

I completed my MSc in Computer Science at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), where I wrote my thesis in the [Visual Computing and AI Lab](https://niessnerlab.org/) under the supervision of [Prof. Matthias Nießner](https://niessnerlab.org//members/matthias_niessner/profile.html). Prior to that, I studied at the University of California at Davis (go ags 🥳), where I earned a double BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

### [STINet: Surface Texture Inpainting Using Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/johnpeterflynn/surface-texture-inpainting-net)

<div class="pub-year">Master's Thesis, 2022</div>

<div class="pub-authors">

**John Peter Flynn**

</div>

<div class="pub-description">

Master's thesis exploring graph neural networks for completing texture on partially-textured 3D meshes. Unlike traditional 2D image inpainting, STINet operates directly on mesh surfaces, leveraging vertex positions, normals, and connectivity to predict vertex colors. This represents the first application of GNNs to surface texture completion.
